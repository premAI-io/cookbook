      <p style="margin: 0;">We present Prem AI cookbook. The cookbook consists of a set of examples and use cases which you can apply with ease using the Prem platform. Additionally, we also show our presence in the popular Generative AI open-source community. Examples in our cookbook also show how we can use <a href="https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/providers/premai/#chat-completions">Langchain</a>, <a href="https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/premai/">llama-index</a>, <a href="https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/api/language_model_clients/PremAI">Stanford DSPy</a>, and <a href="https://qdrant.tech/documentation/embeddings/premai/">Qdrant</a> in building different use cases or just swap out your LLM/embedding provider with Prem in just a few lines of code.</p>

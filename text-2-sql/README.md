## Using Prem AI and DSPy to generate SQL from Text

In this cookbook, we will explore how we can use [PremAI SDK](/get-started/sdk.mdx) and [DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) to generate SQL from text. You can either checkout the notebook or [checkout the docs](https://docs.premai.io/cookbook/text-2-sql) section to follow along with this tutorial. 

### Before getting started

If you want to run the jupyter notebook, create a new environment and install all the dependencies from `requirements.txt`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have an account at [Prem AI Platform](https://app.premai.io) and a valid [project id and an API Key](https://docs.premai.io/introduction) for running this notebook.

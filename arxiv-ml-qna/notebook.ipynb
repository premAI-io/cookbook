    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this tutorial is simple. We are going to build a simple RAG pipeline using the above mentioned tools to search through relevant papers in arXiv and answer user questions correctly citing those answers. So high level here are the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download a sample dataset from HuggingFace for our experiment. We are going to use [ML-ArXiv-Papers](https://huggingface.co/datasets/CShorten/ML-ArXiv-Papers) which contains a huge subset of Machine Learning paper. This dataset contains the title of the paper and the abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once download, we do some preprocessing (which includes converting the data into proper formats, and converting the dataset into smaller batches)\n",
    "3. After this, we get the embeddings using Prem Embeddings and initializing a Qdrant Collection to store those embedding and it's corresponding data.\n",
    "4. After this we connect this Qdrant collection instance to DSPy and build a simple RAG Module.\n",
    "5. Finally we test this with some sample questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds interesting right? So without furthur adue let's start by installing and importing all the important packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started, we need to create a new virtual environment and install all our required packages from this [requirements.txt](https://github.com/premAI-io/cookbook/ml-arxiv-qna/requirements.txt) file. To install Qdrant engine, you need to have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. You can build and run the Qdrant's official docker image using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \\\n",
    "    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \\\n",
    "    qdrant/qdrant\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- REST API will run in: `localhost:6333`\n",
    "- Web UI will run in: `localhost:6333/dashboard`\n",
    "- GRPC API will run in: `localhost:6334`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all the dependencies are installed, we import the following packages"

Under suitable regularity conditions on the admissible predictors,\\nthe underlying family of probability distributions and the loss function, we\\ngive an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor\\nperformance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions.

      "[\"  In many physical, statistical, biological and other investigations it is\\ndesirable to approximate a system of points by objects of lower dimension\\nand/or complexity. For this purpose, Karl Pearson invented principal component\\nanalysis in 1901 and found 'lines and planes of closest fit to system of\\npoints'. The famous k-means algorithm solves the approximation problem too, but\\nby finite sets instead of lines and planes. This chapter gives a brief\\npractical introduction into the methods of construction of general principal\\nobjects, i.e. objects embedded in the 'middle' of the multidimensional data\\nset. As a basis, the unifying framework of mean squared distance approximation\\nof finite datasets is selected. Principal graphs and manifolds are constructed\\nas generalisations of principal components and k-means principal points. For\\nthis purpose, the family of expectation/maximisation algorithms with nearest\\ngeneralisations is presented. Construction of principal graphs with controlled\\ncomplexity is based on the graph grammar approach.\\n\", \"  In this paper, we study the application of sparse principal component\\nanalysis (PCA) to clustering and feature selection problems. Sparse PCA seeks\\nsparse factors, or linear combinations of the data variables, explaining a\\nmaximum amount of variance in the data while having only a limited number of\\nnonzero coefficients. PCA is often used as a simple clustering technique and\\nsparse factors allow us here to interpret the clusters in terms of a reduced\\nset of variables. We begin with a brief introduction and motivation on sparse\\nPCA and detail our implementation of the algorithm in d'Aspremont et al.\\n(2005). We then apply these results to some classic clustering and feature\\nselection problems arising in biology.\\n\", '  We present three generalisations of Kernel Principal Components Analysis\\n(KPCA) which incorporate knowledge of the class labels of a subset of the data\\npoints. The first, MV-KPCA, penalises within class variances similar to Fisher\\ndiscriminant analysis. The second, LSKPCA is a hybrid of least squares\\nregression and kernel PCA. The final LR-KPCA is an iteratively reweighted\\nversion of the previous which achieves a sigmoid loss function on the labeled\\npoints. We provide a theoretical risk bound as well as illustrative experiments\\non real and toy data sets.\\n']\n"

       "['  In manifold learning, algorithms based on graph Laplacians constructed from\\ndata have received considerable attention both in practical applications and\\ntheoretical analysis. In particular, the convergence of graph Laplacians\\nobtained from sampled data to certain continuous operators has become an active\\nresearch topic recently. Most of the existing work has been done under the\\nassumption that the data is sampled from a manifold without boundary or that\\nthe functions of interests are evaluated at a point away from the boundary.\\nHowever, the question of boundary behavior is of considerable practical and\\ntheoretical interest. In this paper we provide an analysis of the behavior of\\ngraph Laplacians at a point near or on the boundary, discuss their convergence\\nrates and their implications and provide some numerical results. It turns out\\nthat while points near the boundary occupy only a small part of the total\\nvolume of a manifold, the behavior of graph Laplacian there has different\\nscaling properties from its behavior elsewhere on the manifold, with global\\neffects on the whole manifold, an observation with potentially important\\nimplications for the general problem of learning on manifolds.\\n',\n",

We assume that the manifold satisfies a smoothness condition and that\\nthe noise distribution has compact support. We show that the optimal rate of\\nconvergence is n^{-2/(2+d)}. Thus, the minimax rate depends only on the\\ndimension of the manifold, not on the dimension of the space in which M is\\nembedded.\\n',\n",
